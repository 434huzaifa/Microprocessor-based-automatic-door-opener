# Microprocessor-based-automatic-door-opener.
This was my Computer Architecture project. I found some similar projects on online. But it felt complex to me. That is why I combine hard and easy and made a doable project. I included my all project file. if read the project report you will easily get the idea how the circuit and code is working. also Presentaion will help you a lot. i tried to make presentation as visual as possible so anyone can understand easily
